Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/vanillaSlice/the-mono/tree/main/projects) for a list of projects I've
worked on in my free time. Here are some I'm particularly proud of:

* [Dawdle](https://github.com/vanillaSlice/the-mono/tree/main/projects/dawdle) - A project organisation tool
* [Tiny](https://github.com/vanillaSlice/the-mono/tree/main/projects/tiny) - A small blog app
* [URL Shortener](https://github.com/vanillaSlice/the-mono/tree/main/projects/urlshortener) - A simple URL shortener
* [Strimko](https://github.com/vanillaSlice/the-mono/tree/main/projects/strimko) - A logic puzzle similar to [Sudoku](https://sudoku.com/)
* [Blueprint Pong](https://github.com/vanillaSlice/the-mono/tree/main/projects/blueprint-pong), [Jumpy Block](https://github.com/vanillaSlice/the-mono/tree/main/projects/jumpy-block), and [Snake](https://github.com/vanillaSlice/the-mono/tree/main/projects/snake) - Clones of various games
