![Cover](./cover.jpg)

## Chapter One: The Multiplier Effect

* Multipliers are leaders who elevate those around them, they bring out the best in them
* Diminishers are leaders who don't get the best out of people, often bringing them down
* Multipliers are genius makers
* Under Diminishers, people feel underutilised
* Multipliers get the most out of people
* Diminishers see themselves as being intellectually superior
* Multipliers see the intelligence in others
* The five disciplines of the Multiplier:
  * Attracting and optimising talent
  * Creating intensity that requires best thinking
  * Extending challenges
  * Debating decisions
  * Instilling ownership and accountability
* Multipliers have a hard-edge, they expect a lot from people
* Multipliers don't play small, they play big and invite others to do so
* Multipliers have a sense of humour and can see the light in things
* People can accidentally become Diminishers
* There is a spectrum from Multiplier to Diminisher that we can fall on
