## Chapter One: Management 101

* One-on-one meetings:
  * Should be regular
  * Should create a human connection
  * Should be a two-way meeting, the manager shouldn't drive the entire agenda
* Feedback and workplace guidance:
  * Should get feedback regularly and not just for performance reviews
  * Praise in public, criticise in private
* Training and career growth:
  * A manager helps find resources and training for career growth
  * They also should help with promotions
* How to be managed:
  * Spend time thinking about what you want
  * You are responsible for yourself
  * Give your manager a break
  * Choose your managers wisely

## Chapter Two: Mentoring

* Mentoring can be a two-way street of learning
* Interns:
  * Have a meaningful project for them to work on
  * Check-in regularly
  * Listen carefully to them
  * Communicate clearly what is expected of them
* New hires:
  * Introduce the new person around and build networks
  * Allow them to update the onboarding docs as they go through them
  * Network building is a worthwhile investment of your time and energy
* 'Alpha geeks' make terrible mentors
* Like doesn't have to mentor like
* Key takeaways:
  * Be curious and open-minded
  * Listen and speak their language
  * Make connections

## Chapter Three: Tech Lead

* Patrick Kua, "A leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at least 30 percent of their time
writing code with the team."
* Tech leads aren't necessarily the most technically skilled person on the team
* Focus more on the team and how you can empower them
* Learn to step away from the code
* Learn to manage your time
* Roles of a tech lead:
  * Systems architect and business analyst
  * Project planner
  * Software developer and team leader
* Is often considered a temporary role on the way toward a promotion
* Explain technical details, not everybody is a techie
* How to be a great tech lead:
  * Understand the architecture
  * Be a team player
  * Lead technical decisions
  * Communicate

## Chapter Four: Managing People

* Starting a new reporting relationship off right:
  * Build trust and rapport
  * Create a 30/60/90 day plan
  * Encourage participation by updating the new hire documentation
  * Communicate your style and expectations
  * Get feedback from your new hire
* Communicating with your team:
  * Have regular 1-1s
  * Don't cancel 1-1s often, if so, reschedule
* Different 1-1 styles:
  * The to-do list meeting
  * The catch-up
  * The feedback meeting
  * The progress report
  * Getting to know you
  * Mix it up
* Delegating effectively:
  * Use the team's goals to understand which details you should dig into
  * Gather information from the systems before going to the people
  * Adjust your focus depending on the stage of projects

## Chapter Five: Managing a Team

* Being a good manager isn't about having the most technical knowledge
* Staying in the code, even if it is just bug fixes, is important as a manager
* Debugging dysfunctional teams:
  * Not shipping
  * People drama
  * Unhappiness due to overwork
  * Collaboration problems
* You don't have to shield your team from everything
* How to drive good decisions:
  * Create a data-driven team culture
  * Flex your own product muscles
  * Look into the future
  * Review the outcomes of your decisions and projects
  * Run retrospectives for the processes and day-to-day
* Seek to be kind not nice
* Team cohesion destroyers:
  * The brilliant jerk
  * The noncommunicator
  * The employee who lacks respect

## Chapter Six: Managing Multiple Teams

* At this point it's tricky to be as involved in the code, but try to do code reviews
* Try to set aside some block of time in the week for a creative endeavour e.g. blog posts
* Make sure meetings are a productive use of people's time
* Make sure you are prioritising your time
* Delegate simple and frequent tasks
* Handle simple and infrequent tasks yourself
* Use complex and infrequent tasks as learning opportunities to delegate
* Delegate complex and frequent tasks to your development team
* Use the "yes, and" approach instead of flat "no" when being asked if something is possible, state that it could impact other projects
* "Help me say yes", encourage people to try to persuade you
* Measures of a healthy development team:
  * Frequency of releases
  * Frequency of code check-ins
  * Frequency of incidents
* Don't isolate your teams into an "us and them" culture
* Go home! Switch off, don't burn yourself out

## Chapter Seven: Managing Managers

* Don't neglect individual teams and members at this level
* Organise skip-level meetings, say once a quarter, with your direct report's direct reports
* Managers who you manage should make your life easier, don't neglect them, make sure they have relevant training
* Avoid being a people pleaser
* Help people stop being people pleasers by feeling safer to say no
* Coach new managers and be ready to help them in the first six months
* Ensure managers are the right cultural fit
* If managing areas unknown to you (QAs, data scientists), talk to people and learn, get out of your comfort zone
* Find problems in underperforming teams as if you are debugging
* Getting comfortable with estimation, provide updates even when not asked for them
* Ensure there is time for technical projects as well as features on roadmaps
* Oversee technical investment and stay abrest of technical trends

## Chapter Eight: The Big Leagues
