## Chapter 1: What is XP?

Extreme Programming (XP) is a style of programming that includes techniques and principles to deliver
better quality software. It includes techniques such as small iterations, short cycles, fast feedback,
and the ability to adapt to changing requirements

## Section 1: Exploring XP

### Chapter 2: Learning to Drive

Driving isn't a case of going in a straight line. It's about being constantly aware and making small
adjustments. This is fundamental to XP.

### Chapter 3: Values, Principles, and Practices

Values are the root of things we like and don't like in a situation. Practices are evidence of values.
Practices are clear. Practices bring accountability to values. Because values and practices are an ocean
apart i.e. values should be the same regardless of situation but practices may not, we need to bridge
them via principles. Principles are domain-specific guidelines for life.

### Chapter 4: Values

XP embraces five values to guide development:

* Communication - this is the most important
* Simplicity - strive to eliminate wasted complexity
* Feedback - change is inevitable, change requires feedback
* Courage
* Respect

### Chapter 5: Principles

Principles that guide XP:

* Humanity - understand that people develop software
* Economics - ensuring what you're doing has business value
* Mutual Benefit - every activity should benefit all concerned
* Self-Similarity - try copying the structure of one solution into a new context
* Improvement - there is no perfect process (adjective) but you can perfect your process (verb)
* Diversity - teams need to bring together a variety of skills
* Reflection - good teams think about how and why they are working
* Flow - delivering a steady flow of valuable software
* Opportunity - learn to see problems as opportunities for change
* Redundancy - stop defects using multiple practices e.g. pair programming, continuous integration, daily deployments
* Failure - failure imparts knowledge
* Quality - pushing quality higher often results in faster delivery
* Baby Steps - momentous change taken all at once is dangerous
* Accepted Responsibility - is cannot be assigned, it can only be accepted

### Chapter 6: Practices

Practices themselves are barren unless given purpose by values.

### Chapter 7: Primary Practices

* Sit Together - opens up communication
* Whole Team - people need a sense of "team", include people with all the skills needed to succeed, avoid splitting across multiple teams
* Informative Workspace - people going into the workspace should be able to see how a project is going in fifteen seconds i.e. story cards on a wall
* Energized Work - work only as many hours as you can be productive
* Pair Programming - write all production programs with two people sitting at one machine (DON'T AGREE WITH THIS)
* Stories - plan using units of customer-visible functionality
* Weekly Cycle - plan work a week at a time
* Quarterly Cycle - plan work a quarter at a time
* Slack - don't overcommit, give yourself slack to deliver to commitments
* Ten-Minute Build - automatically build the system and run tests in ten minutes
* Continuous Integration - integrate and test changes after no more than a couple of hours
* Test-First Programming - write a failing automated test before changing any code
* Incremental Design - invest in the design of the system every day
