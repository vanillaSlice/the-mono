## Chapter 1: What is XP?

Extreme Programming (XP) is a style of programming that includes techniques and principles to deliver
better quality software. It includes techniques such as small iterations, short cycles, fast feedback,
and the ability to adapt to changing requirements

## Section 1: Exploring XP

### Chapter 2: Learning to Drive

Driving isn't a case of going in a straight line. It's about being constantly aware and making small
adjustments. This is fundamental to XP.

### Chapter 3: Values, Principles, and Practices

Values are the root of things we like and don't like in a situation. Practices are evidence of values.
Practices are clear. Practices bring accountability to values. Because values and practices are an ocean
apart i.e. values should be the same regardless of situation but practices may not, we need to bridge
them via principles. Principles are domain-specific guidelines for life.

### Chapter 4: Values

XP embraces five values to guide development:

* Communication - this is the most important
* Simplicity - strive to eliminate wasted complexity
* Feedback - change is inevitable, change requires feedback
* Courage
* Respect

### Chapter 5: Principles
