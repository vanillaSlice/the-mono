## Chapter One: Professionalism

* Take responsibility
* Do no harm to function
  * QA should find nothing
  * You must know it works
  * Automated QA
* Do no harm to structure
* Work ethic
  * Know your field
  * Continuous learning
  * Practice
  * Collaboration
  * Mentoring
  * Know your domain
  * Identify with your employer/customer
  * Humility

## Chapter Two: Saying No

* Professionals are expected to say no
* The most important time to say no is when the stakes are highest
* Play adversarial roles with your manager to achieve the best possible outcome
* Healthy teams strive to find a way to say yes but you have to be unafraid to say no to get to the right yes
* Dropping professional disciplines (e.g. code quality) is not a way to solve problems

## Chapter Three: Saying Yes

* Say what you'll do. Mean it. Do it.
* Words and phrases to look out for which are signs of noncommitment:
  * need/should
  * hope/wish
  * let's
* Only commit to things that you have full control of
* If you are relying on other people, still commit to the parts you have control all
* Professionals look for creative ways to say yes
* Professionals aren't obscure or vague, they give a definite yes or no and highlight any uncertainties
* Don't "try", you either will or won't

## Chapter Four: Coding

* Be prepared; don't write code when you're tired or worried
* Avoid "the Zone" you can lose context here
* Don't be rude when interrupted
* Pairing can help with writer's block
* Debugging is important but try to reduce the time you do it by creating fewer bugs. Professionals create few bugs
* Know when to walk a away from a problem, you'll be surprised that you might solve it in the shower or on a drive
* Don't be late, provide updates, and don't rush
* Don't say you're done or change the definition of done
* Ask for help when you need it and help others
* It is your duty to mentor more junior engineers

## Chapter Five: Test Driven Development

* The three laws of TDD:
  * You aren't allowed to write any production code until you have written a failing unit test
  * You aren't allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail (not compiling is failing)
  * You aren't allowed to write more production code that it sufficient to pass the current failing unit test
* Benefits
  * Certainty
  * Fewer defects
  * More courage to make changes and clean-up code
  * Acts as documentation

## Chapter Six: Practicing

* Practice in your own time, it is not on your employer to keep your skills sharp
* Do coding katas
* Contribute to open-source
* Code in different languages from your job
