## Chapter One: Professionalism

* Take responsibility
* Do no harm to function
  * QA should find nothing
  * You must know it works
  * Automated QA
* Do no harm to structure
* Work ethic
  * Know your field
  * Continuous learning
  * Practice
  * Collaboration
  * Mentoring
  * Know your domain
  * Identify with your employer/customer
  * Humility

## Chapter Two: Saying No

* Professionals are expected to say no
* The most important time to say no is when the stakes are highest
* Play adversarial roles with your manager to achieve the best possible outcome
* Healthy teams strive to find a way to say yes but you have to be unafraid to say no to get to the right yes
* Dropping professional disciplines (e.g. code quality) is not a way to solve problems
