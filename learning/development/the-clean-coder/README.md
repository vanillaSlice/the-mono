## Chapter One: Professionalism

* Take responsibility
* Do no harm to function
  * QA should find nothing
  * You must know it works
  * Automated QA
* Do no harm to structure
* Work ethic
  * Know your field
  * Continuous learning
  * Practice
  * Collaboration
  * Mentoring
  * Know your domain
  * Identify with your employer/customer
  * Humility

## Chapter Two: Saying No

* Professionals are expected to say no
* The most important time to say no is when the stakes are highest
* Play adversarial roles with your manager to achieve the best possible outcome
* Healthy teams strive to find a way to say yes but you have to be unafraid to say no to get to the right yes
* Dropping professional disciplines (e.g. code quality) is not a way to solve problems

## Chapter Three: Saying Yes

* Say what you'll do. Mean it. Do it.
* Words and phrases to look out for which are signs of noncommitment:
  * need/should
  * hope/wish
  * let's
* Only commit to things that you have full control of
* If you are relying on other people, still commit to the parts you have control all
* Professionals look for creative ways to say yes
* Professionals aren't obscure or vague, they give a definite yes or no and highlight any uncertainties
* Don't "try", you either will or won't
